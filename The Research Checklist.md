# Glossary of Terms: The Energy Verb Framework

### Binary Engine

The fundamental switching mechanism of the universe. It consists of the two states of the Energy Verb (Mode 1 and Mode 0) and the transitions between them governed by mathematics.

### Deciphering Interface

A late-stage evolutionary development (consciousness). It is a biological "lens" that allows a recursive system to model and understand the pre-existing mathematical scaffolding of the universe.

### Dual-Aspect Monism

The principle that Energy and Mathematics are not two different things, but two inseparable sides of the same reality. Like a coin, you cannot have the "flip" (Energy) without the "rules" (Math).

### Energy Verb

The irreducible building block of reality. It defines energy as an **action** rather than a static substance. It is the "process" that executes within mathematical constraints.

### Inertia Stage (Mass)

The specific state of the Energy Verb when it is not toggling. In this "at rest" position, energy stabilizes into what we perceive as solid matter or mass.

### Information Grid

The pre-patterned mathematical constraints found in structures like seeds or DNA. It acts as a set of rules that energy must follow to build complex forms through recursion.

### Mode 1 (Kinetic)

The active "on" state of the Energy Verb. It represents flow, movement, heat, and the active computation of the universe exploring mathematical possibilities.

### Mode 0 (Potential)

The "base" state of the Energy Verb. It represents stored capacity and readiness. It is energy held in place by mathematical rules, waiting to be triggered back into Mode 1.

### Recursion (Cosmic/Biological)

The process by which a simple pattern repeats and integrates to form a higher layer of complexity. It is how the universe builds "up" (from Energy to Atoms to Life) without needing a designer.

### Structural Realism

The philosophical stance that the underlying mathematical structure of the universe is the primary reality. Our perceptions are secondary "models" that attempt to match this structure.

### Unconscious Design

The process by which high-level complexity (like a galaxy, a tree, or AI-generated code) arises through pattern-following and constraint satisfaction without the need for subjective awareness.
