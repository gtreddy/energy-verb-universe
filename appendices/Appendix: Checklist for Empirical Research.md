To ground the **Energy Verb** framework in established science, this appendix serves as a bridge between your ontology and measurable physics. It identifies where current data supports your framework and where future research can be directed.

## Appendix: Checklist for Empirical Research

This checklist organizes the "Energy Verb" concepts into verifiable scientific domains. Researchers can use these anchors to test the structural correspondence of the framework.

### 1. The Energy Verb & Binary Modes

* **[ ] Relativistic Mass as Inertia:** Investigate the transition of kinetic energy into rest mass (inertia) in high-energy particle collisions. Does the  relationship behave as a "mode switch" consistent with the **Inertia Stage**?
* **[ ] Vacuum Fluctuations:** Analyze Zero-Point Energy as the baseline toggle between **Mode 1 (Kinetic)** and **Mode 0 (Potential)**. Does the "jitter" of the vacuum represent the fundamental binary pulse of the universe?
* **[ ] QFT Excitation Patterns:** Map Quantum Field Theory (QFT) excitations as "verbs." Confirm if particles can be mathematically treated strictly as field-actions rather than static nouns.

### 2. Mathematics as Primary Constraint

* **[ ] Noether’s Theorem:** Study the link between mathematical symmetry and conservation laws. Does the "math-first" approach explain why energy is conserved (constrained) without a physical "enforcer"?
* **[ ] Fine-Tuning via Constraint Satisfaction:** Apply computer models to see if "Life-friendly" universes emerge inevitably from specific mathematical bounds rather than by random chance.

### 3. Recursive Complexity & Information

* **[ ] Dissipative Structures:** Research Ilya Prigogine’s work on how energy flow through open systems creates order. Can this be quantified as the **Mode 1 to Pattern** transition?
* **[ ] Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Use IIT metrics to measure the "recursion depth" of a system. Does the "Deciphering Interface" (consciousness) correlate with a specific threshold of mathematical recursion?

### 4. Biological & Technological Self-Building

* **[ ] Autocatalytic Sets:** Research the "Metabolism-First" hypothesis of abiogenesis. Does the math of chemical recursion explain the jump from "Pattern" to "Self-Maintaining System"?
* **[ ] AI Design Efficiency:** Compare AI-generated structural designs with natural biological structures (like bone growth). Does the shared "unconscious optimization" prove that design is a function of math, not mind?
