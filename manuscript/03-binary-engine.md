## Chapter 3: The Binary Engine 

### The Logic of Transformation

The universe is a system of state-switching.
It does not create new energy; it changes the mode of the "Verb".
Mathematics dictates when and how these modes switch.

### Mode 1: Kinetic Flow (The Active State)

Mode 1 is the "flip" of the energy coin.
It is the state of active change, dynamics, and process.
In this mode, energy is "doing"—it is the heat of a star or the movement of a field.
Kinetic flow represents the universe exploring mathematical possibilities.

### Mode 0: Potential Readiness (The Base State)

Mode 0 is the state of stored capacity.
It is energy held in readiness by mathematical constraints.
In this mode, energy is stabilized but not yet "at rest" as mass.
It is the "Information" stage, where flow is constrained but still part of the active pulse.

### The Inertia Stage: Forming Mass

When the energy coin is not flipping, it enters the **Inertia Stage**.
In this rest position, it forms what we perceive as mass.
Mass is not a separate building block.
It is the state of the "Verb" when it is held in a stable, mathematical potential.
