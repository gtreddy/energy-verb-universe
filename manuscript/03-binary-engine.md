## Chapter 3: The Binary Engine – Modes of the Energy Verb

### The Logic of Transformation

The universe is a system of state-switching. It does not create new energy; it changes the mode of the "Verb." Mathematics dictates when and how these modes switch. The binary engine (0 and 1) is the core of all physical reality. 

### Mode 0: Kinetic Flow

Mode 0 is the "flip" of the energy coin. It is the active state of change, dynamics, and process. In this mode, energy is "doing"—it is the heat of a star or the movement of a field. Kinetic flow represents the computation of the universe exploring mathematical possibilities. 

### Mode 1: Potential Readiness

Mode 1 is the state of stored capacity. It is energy held in readiness by mathematical constraints. In this mode, energy is stabilized but not yet "at rest" as mass. It is the "Information" stage, where flow is constrained but still part of the active pulse. 

### Interconversions: How the Engine Cycles

The engine cycles because of mathematical necessity. 

* 
**Actualisation**: When Kinetic flow (0) is forced by constraints into a stable state. 


* 
**Release**: When Potential capacity (1) is triggered back into active flow. 


* 
**Inertia (Mass)**: The specific rest state when the binary engine settles into a stable pattern. 



Everything we see is a result of these interconversions. From the birth of particles to the death of stars, the binary engine is always running.
